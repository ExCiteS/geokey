# GeoKey Changelog

## Version 0.7

- Adds `core.mixins`, that provide mixins for shared functionality, e.g. creating where clauses for user groups and subsets.
- Removes `/api/projects/:project_id/contributions/search` endpoint. Searching for contributions can now be implemented via `/api/projects/:project_id/contributions/search={query}`

- The following files have been moved or renamed:
    - `geokey/static/admin.usergroup.data.js` > `geokey/static/admin.filters.data.js`
    - `geokey/templates/users/data_fields_rules.html` > `geokey/templates/snippets/data_fields_rules.html`
    - `geokey/users/templatetags/tags.py` > `geokey/users/templatetags/filter_tags.py`

## Version 0.6

- Separation of contribution serialiser into parser, serialiser and renderer. This enables rendering of geographic data into formats other than GeoJSON.
- Adds KML renderer for geopagice data
- Adds ENABLE_VIDEO flag in settings. If you do not plan to support video uploads set this to `false`.
- Adds number of comments and files to contributions serialisation.
- Removed data groupings; access to data is now regulated via filters attached to user groups.
- Fixes various bugs:

    - Fixed #253: If a file is upload, that is not an image or video the file will be shown as not found
    - Fixed #254: Redirect to originally requested page after logging in is working again
    - Fixed #255: Sets contribution status to â€˜active' when response to a comment is changed from open to 'resolved'
